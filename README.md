Create a basic Azure infrastructure
Cloud Module Week 2 Assignment Presentation

This week, as part of the assignment, I performed tasks related to creating, managing, and subsequently cleaning up basic cloud resources on Microsoft Azure. I completed the tasks step by step as follows:

1. Creating an Azure Account
First, I created an Azure account by entering my personal information (address and banking details) on the Microsoft Azure platform.

2. Creating a Resource Group
I logged into the Azure portal (portal.azure.com) and created a new resource group. I named the resource group MyResourceVit-6.

3. Creating a Virtual Network
Within the resource group, I created a virtual network. I named the virtual network MyNetworkVit-6, setting up a network infrastructure that allows virtual machines to communicate with each other.![2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1d500cc-878d-48a5-92de-cabe72760906)


4. Setting Up a Windows 11 Virtual Machine
I created a Windows 11 virtual machine through the Azure portal. During the setup, I specified the required username and password. This virtual machine was used to perform basic tasks as part of the assignment.![3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92c9bb5e-0df1-4139-8b7e-8744878b0212)

5. Adding a Disk and Attaching it to the Virtual Machine
After creating the virtual machine, I navigated to the Disks section in the left menu of the Azure portal and added a new disk. I attached this disk to the Windows 11 virtual machine I had previously created. This step was performed to increase the storage capacity of the virtual machine.![5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c691a0eb-94cf-4420-8be4-f437937edeb0)


6. Accessing the Virtual Machine via RDP Connection
I downloaded the RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) connection file from the Azure portal and used it to remotely access the virtual machine. During the RDP connection, I logged in using the username and password I had set up when creating the virtual machine. This allowed me to perform the necessary tasks on the virtual machine.![6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb936751-3b66-4452-b411-5942a3d35740)![7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1827070-7c01-4a1f-aa77-70eca4089929)![8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd686569-ee95-44c7-8028-e18aaec24996)




7. Deleting the Resource Group and Cleanup
After completing all the tasks, I deleted the resource group I had created to avoid unnecessary charges. Deleting the resource group automatically removed all the resources within it (virtual machine, virtual network, disk, etc.). This step was an important practice for cost management in the cloud environment.

Conclusion
As part of this assignment, I successfully performed tasks related to creating, managing, and cleaning up basic cloud resources on Microsoft Azure. This process helped me gain foundational knowledge about cloud technologies and the Azure platform. Specifically, I gained experience in creating virtual machines, managing disks, and using resource groups. Additionally, I learned the importance of cost management and proper resource cleanup in the cloud environment.

Thank you for your time and attention.
Best regards,
